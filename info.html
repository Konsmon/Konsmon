        <h1>What is KONSMON?</h1>

        <p>
            Konsmon.space is a DIY chatting website. Users can create their own private or public servers with text and voice channels.
            There is also a possibility to stream your screen to other users. You might wonder: why create such a website
            when apps like Discord or TeamSpeak exist? The answer is simple and straightforward. It was created with the idea of making
            a free and unregulated alternative for small and specific purposes, e.g., university groups, etc.
